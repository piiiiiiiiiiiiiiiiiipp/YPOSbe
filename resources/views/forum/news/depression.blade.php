						<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

						<p >Your doctor may determine a diagnosis of depression based on:</p>
						<ul >
							<li >
								  Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.
							</li>
							<li >
								Lab tests. For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count or test your thyroid to make sure it's functioning properly.
							</li>

							<li >
								Psychiatric evaluation. Your mental health professional asks about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.
							</li>
							<li >
								DSM-5. Your mental health professional may use the criteria for depression listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.
							</li>

						</ul>


						<h2>Types of depression</h2>

						<p >Symptoms caused by major depression can vary from person to person. To clarify the type of depression you have, your doctor may add one or more specifiers. A specifier means that you have depression with specific features, such as:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li >
								<b>Anxious distress</b> — depression with unusual restlessness or worry about possible events or loss of control
							</li>
							<li >
								Mixed features — simultaneous depression and mania, which includes elevated self-esteem, talking too much and increased energy
							</li>
							<li >
								Melancholic features — severe depression with lack of response to something that used to bring pleasure and associated with early morning awakening, worsened mood in the morning, major changes in appetite, and feelings of guilt, agitation or sluggishness
							</li>
							<li >
								Atypical features — depression that includes the ability to temporarily be cheered by happy events, increased appetite, excessive need for sleep, sensitivity to rejection, and a heavy feeling in the arms or legs
							</li>
							<li >
								Psychotic features — depression accompanied by delusions or hallucinations, which may involve personal inadequacy or other negative themes
							</li>
							<li >
								Catatonia — depression that includes motor activity that involves either uncontrollable and purposeless movement or fixed and inflexible posture
							</li>
							<li >
								Peripartum onset — depression that occurs during pregnancy or in the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum)
							</li>
							<li >
								Seasonal pattern — depression related to changes in seasons and reduced exposure to sunlight
							</li>
						</ul>



						<h2>Treatment</h2>

						<p>Medications and psychotherapy are effective for most people with depression. Your primary care doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to relieve symptoms. However, many people with depression also benefit from seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional.</p>

						<p>If you have severe depression, you may need a hospital stay, or you may need to participate in an outpatient treatment program until your symptoms improve</p>

						<p>Here's a closer look at depression treatment options.</p>

						<h2>Psychotherapy</h2>

						<p>Psychotherapy is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy or psychological therapy.</p>

						<p>Different types of psychotherapy can be effective for depression, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. Your mental health professional may also recommend other types of therapies. Psychotherapy can help you:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty
							</li>
							<li>
								Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones
							</li>
							<li>
								Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others
							</li>
							<li>
								Find better ways to cope and solve problems
							</li>
							<li>
								Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse
							</li>
							<li>
								Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger
							</li>
							<li>
								Learn to set realistic goals for your life
							</li>
